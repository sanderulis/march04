## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## I think I maybe can *wink wink*

...or can I?

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  2 * x^2 + 3 * x - 10
}

n <- 50
x <- 1:n
y <- f(x) + rnorm(n, sd = n)
df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
model <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2), df)

summary(model)
```
Great, we have a model

```{r}
f_hat <- function(x) {
  model$co[3] * x^2 + model$co[2] * x + model$co[1]
}

plot(df, pch = 3, col = "red")
lines(1:n, f(1:n), col = "blue")
lines(1:n, f_hat(1:n), col = "green")
```
